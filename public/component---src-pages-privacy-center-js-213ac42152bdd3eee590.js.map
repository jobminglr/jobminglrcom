To maintain that trust, we make significant investments to protect your personal data.

Any user can request the following:\n                        <ul className=\"list-disc list-inside pl-6\">\n                            <li>Access to and portability of their personal data</li>\n                            <li>Rectification or deletion of their personal data</li>\n                            <li>Restriction of or objection to certain processing of their personal data</li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </li>\n                    <li>We adhere to principles of privacy by design, which informs how we build and operate our services.</li>\n                    <li>We’re transparent about what personal data we collect and how it’s processed.</li>\n                    <li>We want to ensure the personal data we gather will be used for the purposes of helping our job seekers find jobs, our employers find great candidates, and improving the services we provide to you.</li>\n                    <li>We limit our collection and storage of personal data to what’s adequate, relevant, and necessary.</li>\n                    <li>We strive to keep your personal data accurate and up to date, where appropriate.</li>\n                    <li>We want to process your personal data using appropriate security measures to protect personal data.</li>\n                    <li>We demonstrate accountability and responsibility under applicable privacy laws.</li>\n                </ul>\n\n                <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4\">The Benefits of Data Sharing</h2>\n                <p><em>Why do you need my data anyway?</em> Data sharing provides a range of benefits to job seekers and employers and enables us to improve our services.</p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Data Sharing Means More Employers, More Job Listings, and More Job Seekers</h3>\n                <p>Data sharing allows job seekers to access a broader database of job listings and employers. It also helps employers access more job seekers. For example, one platform may be able to recommend jobs or employers on another platform. It can also help applications, resumes, or job listings work across the platforms. The personal data shared depends on your interaction with the platforms during your job search and application activities.</p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Data Sharing Improves Our Services</h3>\n                <p>Data sharing allows our platforms to provide personalized and improved content, performance, features, and services. For example, our platforms may use and share your previous search or browsing history and your resume or profile information to determine relevant search results and job alerts. Data sharing may also help provide career insights such as company reviews, job listing salary data, interview tips, and more.</p>\n                <h3 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Data Sharing Facilitates Better Security</h3>\n                <p>Sharing data allows our platforms to better protect our users. In particular, it allows affiliated platforms to improve user security and internal operations. It also facilitates troubleshooting and the detection and prevention of fraud and spam.</p>\n\n                <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4\">Platform Activity Recording</h2>\n                <p><strong>What we do with the data.</strong> We process your activity on the platforms to help us better understand how you use them. This helps us improve and inform the products and services we offer, which allows us to help you find jobs.</p>\n                <p>It’s important to note that our platforms may not work as intended without certain data collection and sharing. This includes processing, collecting, analyzing, storing, and sharing personal data across the platforms or with third-party service providers, including in real-time.</p>\n                <p>Data collected can include any and all interactions and communications you have on our platforms. It may also include, without limitation:</p>\n                <ul className=\"list-disc list-inside pl-4 mb-4\">\n                    <li>The areas of the platforms you visit and where you click, scroll, hover, mouseover, or otherwise interact with our platforms</li>\n                    <li>When and for how long each activity occurs</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>For more information, please see the Privacy and Cookie policies for each platform.</p>\n                <p>We consider this processing to be critical to the way our platforms operate, and, at this time, without transferring certain data to JobMinglr's affiliates, we are not able to provide our core products and services to you.

If a platform does not have its privacy or cookie policy in a specific language, it is because the platform does not yet target users in markets where that language applies.</p>\n\n                <h3 className=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2\">Your Privacy Rights</h3>\n                <p className=\"font-semibold\">What privacy rights are available to me on the platforms?</p>\n                <p>We provide a broad suite of privacy rights to all our users globally.
